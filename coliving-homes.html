                    <p>Coliving is a communal lifestyle where people with similar values occupy a private room in a shared space. To understand co-living, it is essential to understand the concept of communal living.esidents in a shared community share not only the living spaces but also intentions, values, ideas, and interests. The commune includes people from different parts of life who have come together to learn from the experience of others and make new friends with whom they can have shared activities.</p>

                <div class="col-sm-12 col-md-8 mt-4">
                    <p>Like single room occupancy, coliving spaces offer residents a personal space in a shared property. However, the occupants share other parts of the apartment, such as the kitchen, bathroom, living room, library, gym, and many others.</p>

                    <p>Today, coliving in Manassas is filled with hundreds of thousands of students, workers, and entrepreneurs because one of the most significant advantages of coliving is affordability.</p>

                    <h1>Who Chooses Coliving?</h1>
                    <p>While various surveys have shown that the primary age group is 19-40, the shared housing arrangement can work with individuals in any age group.</p>
                    <p>The major demographic of coliving spaces comprises employees of startup companies, freelancers, young professionals or students.</p>
                    <h1>How Did It All Start, And Why?</h1>
                    <p>It started in London , from 1933 to 1934, when Wells Coats designed the first shared living space in London called Isokon.</p>
                    <p>Due to rising real estate prices and the hardships of World War II, many people were forced to move in with each other in shared spaces. These spaces were laundry rooms, workspaces, kitchens, and even shared living rooms. However, after the war, this way of living declined and failed.</p>
                    <p>Therefore, we could say that cohabitation was popularized again between 2014 and 2015 when real estate prices skyrocketed, and several companies offering this type of housing were established. The co-living wave took off in major cities like New York and London, and many experts predict that the industry will expand enormously due to the rising prices we’re experiencing. Co-living is a favorite of millennials in today’s world, and some refer to it as adult dorms.</p>
                    <h1>Coliving – How Much Is It?</h1>
                    <p>Coliving prices depend on what you want. For example, if you are looking for a separate room with a queen-size bed, a work desk, wifi, a private closet, and an en suite bathroom, your monthly fee can be higher than $2000.</p>
                    <p>At the same time, if you can share a bathroom with your roommates, the price can decrease significantly. If you need a room with a particular atmosphere or design, best believe you'll be paying for that experience.</p>
                    <p>The location also means a lot, and the facilities offered by each home. Some homes have amenities like a gym, game room, cleaning services, or outdoor areas for parties and community events. The average cost for those spaces can range from $ 1,500 to $ 2,000 a month.</p>
                    <p>However, if the price is more your determining factor and if you have a volatile income or are in-between jobs and a shared space will meet your needs, prices can range from $700 per month.</p>
                    <h1>Where Is Coliving Most Popular?</h1>
                    <p>It’s no secret that Asia is overcrowded. Especially cities as big as Hong Kong.</p>
                    <p>Coliving is one solution to this pervasive problem of overcrowding. More and more people advertise their apartments as coliving spaces. As a result, they save money, meet new people, and enjoy the advantages of coliving.</p>
                    <p>Alexandria Lafci, an author, stated that by 2050, up to 90% of people would live in cities and only 10% in the suburbs. This in itself shows that the coliving business will overgrow.</p>
                    <p>Coliving is the solution to the problem of overcrowded cities. If Alexandria’s prediction is accurate, cities will be overpopulated and inevitably overpriced, which will force people to look for more affordable options. Coliving is the simplest way to do it.</p>
                    <p>The co-living lifestyle is proliferating in urban environments; whether you’re a tenant or a landlord, now is the best time to check out Coliving.</p>
                    <p>In Silicon Valley, for instance, they came up with the concept of a HUB. That’s how Facebook began – they believed in moving people with common interests into one house and working on one project.</p>
